*Energy efficiency*:   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency (regression) - we choose this
1. planning on working with surface area, overall height, and glazing area predictors
1. predicting heating load due to that being more important in vancouver 

**TODO PROJECT PROPOSAL**
- Title
- Summarize the data with tables
- Choose data analysis method and explain why
- Describe how we will visualize our results (we should look at the textbook at their examples)
- What do we expect to find?
- What impact could such findings have?
- What future questions could this lead to?
- Condense to 500 words 

**QUESTIONS TO ASK TA**
- Our graphs look weird so we need to double check if we are allowed to use this data set (the website says we can use regression so it should be fine)
- Ask if download.file or read.xlsx is better
- Ask for clarification on what they want for tables
- Double check if our question is good
