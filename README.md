*Energy efficiency*:   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency (regression) - we choose this
1. planning on working with surface area, overall height, and glazing area predictors
1. predicting heating load due to that being more important in vancouver 

**PROJECT REPORT TODO**
 - everything
 - it seems like 
 
 Title
Introduction:
provide some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your report
clearly state the question you tried to answer with your project
identify and describe the dataset that was used to answer the question
Methods & Results:
describe in written English the methods you used to perform your analysis from beginning to end that narrates the code the does the analysis.
your report should include code which:
loads data from the original source on the web 
wrangles and cleans the data from it's original (downloaded) format to the format necessary for the planned analysis
performs a summary of the data set that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned analysis 
creates a visualization of the dataset that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned analysis

- the part above is already done (from project proposal), though we should add a label the table and figures with a number and a legend
- also we might also need to describe (in words, i.e. not code) what we are doing

- other tasks:
   - performing the data anlaysis (both knn and linear regression)
   - visualize the data analysis
   
   - summarize what you found
   - discuss whether this is what you expected to find?
   - discuss what impact could such findings have?
   - discuss what future questions could this lead to?
   - At least 2 citations of literature relevant to the project (format is your choice, just be consistent across the references).
